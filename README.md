# Sort Algorithms

I made this project for study the most common sorting algorithms we use in general.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

We just need a C compiler in our machine.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Quick Sort     - recursive - 0m0.040s
Merge Sort     - recursive - 0m0.060s
Selection Sort - iterative - 5m38.448s
Insertion Sort - iterative - 2m2.156s
Shell Sort     - iterative - s
Heap Sort      - iterative - s

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
